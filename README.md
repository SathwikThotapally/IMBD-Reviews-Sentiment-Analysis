# IMDB Reviews Sentiment Analysis

This is an ongoing project focused on performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews from the IMDB dataset. The objective is to classify each review as either **positive** or **negative** using machine learning techniques.

The repository currently contains:
- A Jupyter notebook (`IMDBSentiment.ipynb`) that includes data exploration, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation

So far, the workflow has been implemented end-to-end, including:
- Data loading and basic preprocessing
- Text cleaning using NLTK (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)
- Feature extraction (e.g., TF-IDF)
- Model training using traditional ML algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression)
- Model evaluation using metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)


## To-Do

- Organize and clean up the Jupyter notebook with proper structure and headings
- Add visualizations for results (e.g. confusion matrix)


## Dataset

The dataset used contains IMDB movie reviews labeled as either positive or negative. This is a commonly used dataset for binary sentiment classification tasks in NLP.


## Libraries & Tools

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- NLTK

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **In Progress**

All major steps of the ML workflow are complete. The next task is to evaluate the model and organize and clean up the notebook for clarity, structure, and readability.

Stay tuned for updates!
